Write a program which takes a positive number input from the user (N) and output the following as an example:

5
4
3
2
1

for input 5. This demonstrates "Map-Reduce" that is a Divide and Conquer 
paradigm where the parent thread maps work to worker threads from the 
same data set (called "mappers") each having a subset of that data to work on.
When the mappers are done with their work the parent "reducer" takes those 
results from the mappers and aggregates them for the final outcome.
